# Learn About College Degree Outcomes

## Goal of this Project

Many first-generation college students and college students with immigrant parents feel pressured to pursue prestigious career like law or medicine without completely understanding alternative career choices. This dashboard aims to **demystify career prospects based on college majors** by exploring employment rates, wages, and growth opportunties. The goal is to make students feel more empowered and to make more informed, authentic career choices beyond prestige and money.
